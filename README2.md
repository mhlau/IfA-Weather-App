# IfA Weather App (for staff)

## Downloading, Opening, and Running IfA Weather

In https://github.com/mhlau/IfA-Weather-App, click **Download ZIP**. This should download a .zip file that, when unzipped, contains a folder called ```IfA-Weather-App-master```. In ```IfA-Weather-App-master```, open ```IfA Weather App.xcodeproj```. This should open Xcode 5 and the project. 

To run the app on the iOS Simulator, an application packaged with Xcode 5, click the play button at the top left-hand corner of the Xcode window. Make sure that the destination (the second drop-down list at the top left-hand corner) is set to either **iPhone Retina (3.5-inch)** or **iPhone Retina (4-inch)**.
